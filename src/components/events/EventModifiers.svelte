<!-- 
events modifiers

preventDefault — calls event.preventDefault() before running the handler. Useful for client-side form handling, for example.
stopPropagation — calls event.stopPropagation(), preventing the event reaching the next element
passive — improves scrolling performance on touch/wheel events (Svelte will add it automatically where it's safe to do so)
nonpassive — explicitly set passive: false
capture — fires the handler during the capture phase instead of the bubbling phase (MDN docs)
once — remove the handler after the first time it runs
self — only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself
trusted — only trigger handler if event.isTrusted is true. I.e. if the event is triggered by a user action.
